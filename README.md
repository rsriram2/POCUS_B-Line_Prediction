# POCUS B-Line Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data processing pipelines for predicting B-lines in lung ultrasound images using deep learning models. The project involves extensive data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation to develop robust models for B-line detection.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to accurately detect B-lines in lung ultrasound images. B-lines are vertical artifacts seen in lung ultrasound scans that are indicative of various lung pathologies. We have implemented several pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and 3D architectures to achieve this goal.
